Don\'t put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color.\n6. Now it\'s time to prepare the kale.

Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture.\n15. Now it\'s time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly.\n16. Cook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage.\n17.
